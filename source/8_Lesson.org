- Now we've learnt some individual coding techniques, we can try and bring them together to create a nice target shooting game like this:

- Pythagoras invented his theorem in ancient Greek times so we could make video games.
- You may remember this from your maths classes:
[[./img/8-1.png]]
- Given the lengths of a and b we are able to calculate the length of c using the equation above.

- First we'll need some graphics for our game. At the very least, we'll need to load a player and target image.
- Save the two images below into your pyGame folder on your H: drive.
- To keep things neat, make a sub-folder in your pyGame folder and call it =img=. Put both images in there. *NOTE:* If you don't place them into the sub-folder, the code examples used in this lesson won't work.
[[./img/bird1.png]]
[[./img/crossHair.png]] 
- We'll start off by establishing the target's starting =X= and =Y= position on the screen. Add these lines just before your game loop, around line 18:
#+begin_src python 
gameState = "running"  # controls which state the games is in
player1Image = pygame.image.load("img/crossHair.png")
targetImage = pygame.image.load("img/bird1.png")
targetX = 100
targetY = 100
#+end_src
- It should look like this:
[[./img/8-2.png]]
- Using the ideas used in the Mouse lesson, we'll have the target graphic follow the mouse cursor. Add these lines into your game loop, around line 30:
- *NOTE:* This code must be indented in order to work.
#+begin_src python 
screen.fill(white)
mousePos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
player1X = pygame.mouse.get_pos()[0] - 50
player1Y = pygame.mouse.get_pos()[1] - 50

target = screen.blit(targetImage, (targetX, targetY))
player1 = screen.blit(player1Image, (player1X, player1Y))

- In our game, we'll need to know when the player has 'hit' the target bird. 
- We'll draw an imaginary circle around the bird's X, Y coordinates and say that when the player clicks the mouse, if the mouse is inside the circle, they've hit the target. 
- We could also use the idea of how close the player is to the middle to decide their accuracy.
- You've almost certianly covered Pythagoras' theorem in maths, but how does it help us solve this problem?
[[./img/8-4.png]]
- Look at the diagram above for a moment. We can use the variables we already have to establish the X and Y distance from the bird to the target, then apply Pythagoras to see how far away it is. 
** Code It

:END:
- In order to keep the game loop as tidy as possible we will create a function to calculate =c=. 
- The function will need to use the math module's square root method. This isn't built into Python by default, so some extra code in the form of the =math= module must be imported. 
- Add these lines to the top of your program, around line 4
#+begin_src python 
import math

def pythag(pX, pY, tX, tY):
    a = pX - tX
    b = pY - tY
    c = math.sqrt(a ** 2 + b ** 2)
    print (c)
#+end_src
[[./img/8-5.png]]
- Finally, we must call the function and send it the player's and target's =X= and =Y= positions to perform the calculation with. Add this code inside the game loop, near line 44.
- *NOTE:* This code must also be indented in order to work.
#+begin_src python 
pythag(player1X, player1Y, targetX, targetY)
#+end_src
[[./img/8-6.png]]
- Now test your code. Look at the bottom of the pyCharm window. What is this telling you?
- If you're struggling with the concepts, this video tutorial will help with this lesson:

- *Silver:* Add comments explaining your code, then upload it form marking.
- *Gold:* Use the function from the 'Text me' lesson to display how accurate the player was.
- *Platinum:* Use Pygame.draw.line to draw the 3 sides of the triangle, like in the screenshot below.
