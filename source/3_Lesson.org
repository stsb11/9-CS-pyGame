- Start by picking up a template to use in this lesson: 
- [[./doc/pygameDevTemplate.py][Right click and save as - for a fresh template]]
** Learn It

:END:
- All games have interaction with the user, in computing these are known as *Interrupt Events*.
- The code that checks if the user has done something is called an *Event Listener*.
- When a specific event is heard by the Event Lister, an action is then performed by the *Event Handler* code.
- If we look carefully at the template you will see that the event of the user closing the window is already handled.
- We'll add some more event handlers in this lesson, to make our game more interactive.
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- Add the print(event) statement to your code
- [[./img/3-1.PNG]]
- Run your code with =Shift-F10=, then move the mouse around inside the pyGame window and press some keys on the keyboard.
- Look in the interpreter window, located in the bottom-left corner of the pyCharm window.
- You might see output like this:
#+begin_src
<Event(2-KeyDown {'mod': 0, 'unicode': '', 'scancode': 56, 'key': 308})>
<Event(3-KeyUp {'mod': 0, 'key': 308, 'scancode': 56})>
#+end_src
- Try holding the CTRL, ALT or SHIFT keys while pushing other keys. The interpreter window output will now change slightly to show that the keys have been 'modified'. 


- *NOTE:* =KeyUp= and =KeyDown= are different events. What's the difference?

:PROPERTIES:

- *Silver:* Copy and paste lines from the Python console in the bottom-left corner which show the events returned for the following:
   - Right mouse button clicked/released
   - Mouse wheel clicked/released
   - Mouse wheel spin up/down
   - Left mouse button pressed/released
   - Pressing the X to close the window
   - Up arrow press

- We will make a sprite called =player1= follow the mouse. Add these lines of code to your game loop.
- *Note:* Make sure you use tab to double-indent the code so that it sits inside the =for= loop. 
#+begin_src python
screen.fill(black)
mousePosition = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
print(mousePosition)
#+end_src
- The code will look like this:
[[./img/3-2.PNG]]
- Look at the Python terminal window and move the mouse. 
- This is the data we will use to position the =player1= sprite.
- Modify your game loop to the following...
#+begin_src python
screen.fill(black)
mousePosition = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
# print(mousePosition)   <<< UMCOMMENT THIS TO SEE POSITION DATA.
player1X = mousePosition[0]
player1Y = mousePosition[1]
player1 = pygame.draw.rect(screen, red, (player1X, player1Y, 40, 40))
#+end_src
- The code will look like this:
[[./img/3-3.PNG]]
- Run the program with =Shift-F10=. What happens?
- If you're struggling with the tasks, you can go through the notes above using this video tutorial:

- *Gold* The =player1= sprite isn't in the centre of the mouse pointer. Fix this bug and comment each line of your code to explain what it does.
- *Platinum:* You've now covered mouse movement. Modify your code so a different shape is drawn on left or right mouse button clicks.


- /Hint:/ There's a few ways to do the platinum task. You can look online and find a way to do it, or these lines could perhaps be recycled into something useful.
#+begin_src python
if pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0] == True:
    pygame.draw.rect(screen, green, (100, 100, 100, 100))
elif pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[1] == True:
    print("You clicked a different button")
#+end_src
