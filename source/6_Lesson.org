- We are going to make it into a simple game, to learn to use collisions. 
** Try It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: try
:END:
- In addition to the one we made in the previous lesson, we will create another sprite using a basic shape called =target=. We will then detect if =player1= has collided with the =target=.
- First we need a variable to hold the x and y position of the target.
- Add these lines at the bottom of the lines of the game setup section, directly underneath the line that says =player1Image = pygame.transform.scale(player1Image, player1ImageSizeXY)= which you wrote in the last lesson. It'll be around line 20ish. 
#+begin_src python
pygame.mouse.set_visible(False)
targetXY = [500, 500]
#+end_src
- Your code will look a little like this now:
[[./img/6-1.png]]
- Now, we'll draw the target sprite onto the screen.
- Add these lines of code in your game loop, directly underneath the line that says =player1XY = newXPosition, newYPosition= 
- *NOTE:* You'll need to indent each of these lines twice, to that they're part of the =for= event loop.
#+begin_src python
target = pygame.draw.circle(screen, red, (300, 600), 20)
if player1.colliderect(target):
    print("Hit!")
#+end_src
- The code should look like this:
[[./img/6-2.png]]
- Run the code, and see what happens. 
- Printing 'hit' in the console is not very exciting. Let's change the code so the target disappears and reappears at a random =x= and =y= position when touched by the player sprite.
- In order to use the random numbers, we need to =import= some extra code to allow it.
- Add this line at the very top of your program:
#+begin_src python
import random
#+end_src
It'll look like this...
[[./img/6-3.PNG]]
 - Now, we can use a new function called =random.randint()=  to create random numbers for the =x= and =y= postions of the target. Comment out the =print("hit")= line you wrote previously by placing a hash symbol (#) in front of it, then add these lines underneath. Don't forget that they're part of the =IF= block, so will need to be indented with the tab key three times.
#+begin_src python
targetXY[0] = random.randint(0, SCREENWIDTH)
targetXY[1] = random.randint(0, SCREENHEIGHT)
#+end_src
- We will also need to stop hard-coding the coordinates of our target, and start using the new randomly chosen coordinates. A few lines above where you made these changes, find the line that says:
#+begin_src python
target = pygame.draw.circle(screen, red, (300, 600), 20)
#+end_src
- ...and change it to say:
#+begin_src python
target = pygame.draw.circle(screen, red, targetXY, 20)
#+end_src
- The code should look a little like this (the line numbers won't be exact, but will be in this area of the program):
[[./img/6-4.png]]
** Test It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: test
:END:
- Run the program to test it. 
- There are a number of improvements we can make.
- It would be better if the user had to collide with the target *and* click the mouse to score a point. We could add this by changing our collision code slightly. 
- Add another =IF= statement inside the game loop to force the user to click on the target. *NOTE:* Only the first of the lines below is to be added; the others are shown to help you see where to place the code, and help ensure it is indented correctly. 
#+begin_src python
if pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0] == 1:
    if player1.colliderect(target):
        # print("Hit!")
        targetXY[0] = random.randint(0, SCREENWIDTH)
        targetXY[1] = random.randint(0, SCREENHEIGHT)
#+end_src
- The code should look something like this. *NOTE:* The lines of code under the new =IF= statement will all need to be intended.
[[./img/6-5.png]]
- This feature also introduces a bug; the player can hold down the mouse button constantly so that the they just have to touch the target.
- This is slightly more complex to fix. We'll need to create a variable to prevent the player from 'firing' again until until the mouse button is released.
  - Create the =fireLock= variable and set to =0= at the start of the game, so the player can fire. Add this line of code just before your game loop:
#+begin_src python
fireLock = 0
#+end_src
  - ...so it looks like this:
 [[./img/6-6.PNG]]
  - Next, we'll need to set =fireLock= to =1= when the mouse button is pushed, by modifying our =IF= statement from before a little bit. 
  - Find the line that says:
#+begin_src python
if pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0] == 1:
#+end_src
  - and change it to:
#+begin_src python
if pygame.mouse.get_pressed()[0] == 1 and fireLock == 0:
    fireLock = 1
#+end_src
  - The code should now look something like this:
 [[./img/6-7.PNG]]
  - Finally, we'll need to make it so that we only reset =fireLock= to =0= when the mouse button is released. We do this by adding another event listener to our event loop.
  - Add this =IF= statement inside the gameState = "exit" line in your game loop.
#+begin_src python
if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
    fireLock = 0
#+end_src
- It should look like this when done:
[[./img/6-8.PNG]]

- *Silver:* Add comments to your code and in comments below your code.
- *Gold:* The target is currently drawn over the top of the player - fix this bug so that it appears behind. 
- *Platinum:* Change the target circle to an image of your choice instead.
