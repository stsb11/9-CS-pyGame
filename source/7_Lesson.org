- Almost all games require text to be displayed on the screen.
- It would be handy to  make something we can use again and again without writing the code repeatedly.
- In computing this is called a /function/. It is an independent block of code that lives outside the main program and only runs when asked to do so by the main program.
- Functions always sit at the top of the code after the import statements.

- First we need to load a font from the PC's font collection and store it in a variable for later use.
[[./img/7-1.png]]
- Now, we can start to build our function.
- At the top of your code, under the import statements add this code, which creates your function.
[[./img/7-2.png]]
- The function won't run until it's instructed to do so. 
- By 'calling' the function, we tell the function that we’d like it to run. We'll do this from the main body of our code.
- This is called a =Function Call=

** Program It
:PROPERTIES:

- It would be even more useful if we could tell the =textDraw= function which X, Y coordinates we’d like the text to be shown at.
- We can accomplish this by adding a =parameter= to the function.
[[./img/7-4.png]]
- We'll also need to modify the function call so that we send it the values we want to use in our program.

- *Silver:*
 - Add 2 more function calls to draw text at different points on the screen.
 - Add comments to your code, and upload it to [[https://www.bournetolearn.com][BourneToLearn.com]] 
- *Gold:* 
 - Add another paramenter to your function to control the text size.
- *Platinum:*
 - Modify the program so it displays a mouse click counter on the screen, *OR*
 - Modify your function call so the text moves across the screen.
